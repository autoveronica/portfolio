      <p>Client: Ruptly | Industry: Media | Location: Berlin | Role: UI/UX Designer & Graphic Designer</p>
      <p>The Know Your Source case study demonstrated my design process for building an interactive website for educational, marketing, and sales purposes. I adopted UX research methods to establish an intuitive content structure and led design workshops to craft the UI/UX design of the website. As digital technologies develop, it is getting more difficult to distinguish what’s real or fake in the news. In many cases, social media functions as a vehicle to spread rumour, propaganda, and inaccurate reporting. Ruptly’s creative team and I created an engaging, interactive website as part of the Know Your Source project to emphasize once again on sourcing as the foundation of reliable journalism.</p>
