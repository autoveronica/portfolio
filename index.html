    <h3>Workforce Operations Platform</h3>
    <p>Sector: Public Services | Location: London | Role: Product Manager</p>
    <p>I led the 0–1 development of a Workforce Operations Platform—marking a breakthrough in digitalisation across government services. I partnered with stakeholders from multiple public bodies and worked with a multidisciplinary team to shape a product vision focused on faster staffing decisions, clearer communication with frontline staff, and improved operational oversight. I translated service needs into actionable product requirements, led discovery and delivery phases, and collaborated with engineers to deliver a web app using Microsoft Power Platform. The platform enables leadership to manage staff availability, assignments, notifications, and performance insights in one place.</p>
    <p>The product delivered measurable gains in accuracy, efficiency, and operational effectiveness, unlocking significant cost savings and equipping teams with data to support ongoing service improvement.</p>

      <h3>Product Localisation</h3>
      <p>Industry: Edtech SaaS, healthcare | Location: Berlin | Role: Product Manager</p>
      <p>I led product discovery and delivery for localisation at Lecturio, a global medical learning platform. Partnering with engineering, UX research, and customer-facing teams, I introduced a scalable localisation workflow and championed the addition of a language selector. We redesigned key flows to better support international users and improved access to translated subtitles, transcripts, and quiz content across 25+ languages.</p>
      <p>This work enabled broader access to Lecturio's core learning experiences for non-English speakers. We saw increased engagement in Spanish-speaking markets, higher activation rates, and a lift in conversions from first-time buyers. It also laid the groundwork for a more inclusive product strategy, positioning Lecturio to grow its global footprint.</p>

      <p>Industry: Media | Location: Berlin | Role: Product Designer & Product Manager</p>
      <p>I led UX, UI, and end-to-end product development for Ruptly's "Know Your Source" campaign, building an interactive website from 0 to 1 to promote digital media literacy and showcase their Verification Unit. Beyond design, I applied product management skills to scope requirements, prioritise features, and align stakeholders across creative, editorial, and development teams. I ran strategic workshops using the 5 Ws framework, facilitated open card sorting with clients to define the information architecture, and mapped user journeys to inform a clear, engaging UX.</p>
      <p>The resulting website effectively educates users on the importance of source verification in journalism. By transforming complex verification processes into engaging, interactive content, the platform enhances user understanding and trust. This project not only bolstered Ruptly's reputation for transparency but also strengthened relationships with their global network of contributors and clients.</p>

      <h3>Speed Performance Optimisation & Website Migration at <a href="https://perpetua.io/sellics-joins-perpetua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sellics</a></h3>
      <p>Industry: SaaS | Location: Berlin | My role: Marketing Designer & Product Manager</p>
      <p>I led the end-to-end website migration for Sellics, transitioning from Unbounce and HubSpot to a streamlined WordPress solution. Applying product management principles, I scoped requirements, prioritised features using a value vs. complexity model, and coordinated cross-functional teams to enhance site performance and design consistency. I created a lightweight design system using ACF components, rebuilt all landing pages, optimised loading times by removing heavy plugins, and developed a reusable icon font to empower the marketing team.</p>
      <p>Post-migration, the website's GTmetrix speed rating improved from Grade F to B, with analytics tools like Google Analytics and Hotjar indicating increased user engagement through more clicks, taps, and scrolling behaviours. The visual presentation of the brand achieved consistency, and the conversion rate saw a notable increase, reflecting the positive impact of the migration on user experience and business outcomes.</p>

      <h3>Website Redesign at <a href="https://www.anddossantos.com/home-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">und dos Santos</a></h3>
      <p>Industry: Management Consulting | Location: Berlin | My role: Product Manager, UIUX Designer, Frontend Developer</p>
      <p>I led the end-to-end redesign of und dos Santos GmbH's WordPress website, serving as product manager, UX/UI designer, and frontend developer. Applying product management principles, I scoped requirements, prioritised features, and aligned stakeholders to enhance site performance and design consistency. I developed a new branding concept—a metaphorical journey to the “Innovation Space”—to effectively communicate the agency’s unique value proposition. This involved creating a comprehensive style guide, redefining typography and colour palettes, and designing wireframes to improve user flow and satisfaction.</p>
      <p>The revamped website significantly improved user experience, with a redesigned sitemap and enhanced content clarity making it easier for visitors to understand the agency’s services. I optimised for SEO by refining metadata, adding targeted keywords, and implementing backlink strategies to improve discoverability. Multiple conversion options on service pages streamlined the user journey, facilitating quicker engagement. The integration of storytelling and consistent branding strengthened the agency’s market presence and visibility in search rankings.</p>
