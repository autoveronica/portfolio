      <h3>Product Localisation at Lecturio</h3>
      <p>Industry: Edtech SaaS, healthcare | Location: Berlin | Role: Product Manager</p>
      <p>This product improvement allowed non-English speaking users to enjoy a full-blown product experience in their preferred language. It successfully increases registration rates, the number of leads, and first-time buyers. This project helped to bridge the language barrier and make our products more accessible to a broader audience on a global scale, ultimately driving growth and success.</p>

      <h3>Ruptly Website Development</h3>
      <p>Client: Ruptly | Industry: Media | Location: Berlin | Role: UI/UX Designer & Graphic Designer</p>
      <p>The Know Your Source case study demonstrated my design process for building an interactive website for educational, marketing, and sales purposes. I adopted UX research methods to establish an intuitive content structure and led design workshops to craft the UI/UX design of the website.</p>
      <p>As digital technologies develop, it is getting more difficult to distinguish what’s real or fake in the news. In many cases, social media functions as a vehicle to spread rumour, propaganda, and inaccurate reporting. Ruptly’s creative team and I created an engaging, interactive website as part of the Know Your Source project to emphasize once again on sourcing as the foundation of reliable journalism.</p>
